They were very responsive to my needs and flexible to my many reservation changes, and attentive to my needs. At metropole, they pay attention to the details that make a guest stay better, and I appreciated that. Thank you for your service.', 
      'Fab location in the affluent French Quarter, stunning Art Deco style facility, gorgeous food (do take breakfast poolside, a must) a whiskey ðŸ¥ƒ bar that I didnâ€™t get to (foolish!) and, this the reason why I will returnâ€¦ the management and staff are superb. From front of house to house maids to restaurant and bar staff there are splendid.', 
      'We had our mandatory quarantine here for 8 days. Service and food were outstanding! Never felt better taken care of in other 5 star hotels. Although our rooms have seen better days, they were clean, comfortable and still luxurious. Water pressure is EXCELLENT! Looking forward to non-quarantine stays at this hotel. Highly recommended for both pleasure and quarantine.',

      'Dolce has a top-quality hospitality staff with amenities. Very friendly and willing to make your stay comfortable. In particular, Jackie was very helpful in translating stuff for me. He went out of his way to help. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a comfortable stay without all the extra costs that come with it. The hotel is well built and has a very nice gym compared to some other hotels I have been to. The pool is very nice and has a hot tub built into it. And since it is on the top of the roof - it gets sun all day',
      'Wonderful, incredible and really comfortable. A very nice place to be in couple or family. Clean rooms, and wide areas indoor and outdoor. The views of Sunset and down always superb from the pool. Excellent food at the restaurant. Staff are well trained and supportive.',],
